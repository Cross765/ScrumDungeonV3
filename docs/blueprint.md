# **App Name**: Scrum Master's Quest

## Core Features:

- Character Creation: Character creation based on Scrum roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer), each with unique abilities.
- Skill Management: Characters that can increase their abilities (Colaboración, Adaptabilidad, Comunicación, Resoluciones de impedimentos, Priorización, velocidad de ejecución,  Mentalidad ágil).
- Dynamic Storytelling: AI-driven dungeon master tool generates story and adapts challenges based on player decisions and dice rolls, offering a unique, branching narrative with a beginning and end, fully in Spanish.
- Interactive Scrum Board: Interactive board representing the Scrum process, divided into sprints and stages.
- Scrum Events Simulation: Simulated Scrum events: Planning, Daily, Review, Retrospective; as checkpoints within the game narrative.
- Agile Challenges: In-game random events (changing requirements, critical bugs, team conflicts) that challenge the player's agile adaptation and collaboration skills.
- AI Response display: The response from the AI updates the history of the narrative. Updates add content in a container dedicated to the responses from the AI. 

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL (50, 90%, 50%) , equivalent to RGB Hex #F0E68C, a light saturated yellow conveying a sense of creativity and forward motion. This color is vivid enough for a dark color scheme.
- Background color: HSL(50, 20%, 15%) , equivalent to RGB Hex #302E24, a very dark desaturated yellow to ensure good contrast in a dark color scheme.
- Accent color: HSL (20, 90%, 55%), equivalent to RGB Hex #F5A661, is an analogous bright orange that complements the primary color without overwhelming it.
- Body font: 'Literata', serif. Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif. 'Literata' is chosen for readability in the story sections. 'Space Grotesk' adds a touch of digital style suitable for an app about software development processes. 
- Icons should be minimalistic and represent Scrum concepts (sprints, backlog, user stories).
- The layout should follow a clear hierarchy, with the game board, story display, and player information easily accessible.
- Subtle animations during dice rolls, character actions, and Scrum event transitions to engage the user.
